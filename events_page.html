            <article><h4>Music in the Park</h4>Enjoying live music in the park is a perfect way to relax and take in the outdoors. Bring a cozy blanket 
                    or chairs for comfort, along with snacks like cheese and fruit and your favorite drinks to stay refreshed. If the 
                    event goes into the evening, pack a light sweater and maybe some fun lights to enhance the atmosphere. With good company, 
                    great music, and the right setup, a park concert becomes a memorable experience for everyone. Happening every Fri/Sat Night, May - September.
